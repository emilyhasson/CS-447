Your task is to modify the function <TT>buildFST()</TT> below to produce a better FST. You are free to define your own character sets or other helper methods that you require. \n","\n","The FST will finish its analysis for a string after having read its last character. If it accepts the string, it will output the transduced form; if it does not accept it, the FST will output FAIL. Your FST may be non-deterministic (that is, a state may have multiple transitions for the same input character), but each accepted string should only have one analysis. If your FST accepts a string along multiple paths, all of the outputs will be returned and the translation will be marked incorrect: e.g. <TT>hablar ==> hablóhabló</TT>. It will accept a string if it reaches a final state after having read its last character.\n","\n","<font color='green'><b>Hints:</b></font>\n","* <font color='green'>Before beginning, make sure you understand the \"Tutorial: Designing an FST\" video on Coursera.

You are welcome to use more, but if you find yourself with significantly more states you may be on the wrong track.</font>\n","* <font color='green'>As you work, keep a hand-drawn diagram of your FST on paper. You will find it easier to reason about your FST's behavior by looking at your diagram.</font>\n","* <font color='green'>Implement the rules in the order they're described above, and test frequently. It will help to build your FST incrementally, rather than trying to do it all at once.</font>\n","* <font color='green'>The exceptions to rules 2 & 3 (i.e. verbs ending in <TT>-guir</TT> & <TT>-quir</TT>) could be challenging. You might consider implementing these at the very end once all the rules themselves work (these exceptions are not worth as many points as the rules).</font>\n","* <font color='green'>You will sometimes want to transition on all letters except for a few.
